# Audio Classification

To apply Deep Learning techniques to the classification problem of environmental sounds, specifically focusing on the identification of particular urban sounds.
When given an audio sample in a computer readable format (such as a .wav file) of a few seconds duration, we want to be able to determine if it contains one of the target urban sounds with a corresponding Classification Accuracy score. We want our model to return various predictions along with the corresponding probability.

Here is the link to the dataset on kaggle

The code file is a .ipynb file.

If working on jupyter notebook, run this command to download the tensorflow dependencies before executing the code file:

!pip install tensorflow==2.11.0 tensorflow-gpu==2.11.0 tensorflow-io matplotlib

If running on kaggle or collab the above step is not required.
